### New Jersey General Election 2021

These are the raw output files taken from each county that could be accessed through Scytl data.  Each row is a single reporting period, so a single county contains multiple precinct reports that are aggregated up into a total, while showing the total for each precinct at that timeslot.

The single table (nj_2021_general_raw) was split up into multiple output tables/files because of the github file size limit of 100MB.

In the future, these will be preprocessed to have normalized time series data.
